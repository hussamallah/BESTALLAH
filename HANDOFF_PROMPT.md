## 🎯 **SYSTEM BEHAVIOR (AUTHORITATIVE)**

### **Core Engine Contract**

The PFF Quiz Engine is a deterministic, pure-function engine that processes user quiz sessions and produces consistent results. The engine operates on two independent layers:

1. **Line Verdicts (COF)** per family (Control, Pace, Boundary, Truth, Recognition, Bonding, Stress)
2. **Face Presence** via behavioral tells (14 faces; portable across families)

### **Session Flow**

#### **Screen 1: Family Selection**
- User picks 1..7 families
- For every pick, add **+1 C** to that family's `line_state`
- **No face effects** at this stage

#### **Screens 2-8: Question Screens (7 total)**
- **Picked families**: Serve **2 questions** each
- **Not-picked families**: Serve **3 questions** each in **C→O→F** order
- **Total questions**: Always **18** (except picks=0 which gives 21)

#### **Question Structure**
Each question has exactly 2 options (A, B), where each option:
- Defines a `lineCOF` for the current family screen
- Contains 0–3 face tells (max 1 tell per face per option)
- Maps to behavioral indicators for face presence detection

### **Answer Processing**

#### **AnswerEvent Structure**
On every user click, append an AnswerEvent:
```json
{
  "qid": "string",
  "familyScreen": "Control|Pace|Boundary|Truth|Recognition|Bonding|Stress",
  "picked_key": "A|B",
  "lineCOF": "C|O|F",
  "tells": [
    { "face_id": "FACE/Control/Sovereign", "tell_id": "TELL/Control/Sovereign/sets-call" }
  ],
  "ts": "ISO-8601",
  "latency_ms": 0
}
```

#### **State Updates**

**Line State Updates:**
- If `lineCOF === "C"` → `line_state[family].C += 1`
- If `lineCOF === "O"` → `line_state[family].O_seen = true`
- If `lineCOF === "F"` → `line_state[family].F_seen = true`

**Face Ledger Updates:**
For each tell in the AnswerEvent:
- Mark question hit: `face_ledger[face].questions_hit.add(qid)`
- Mark family hit: `face_ledger[face].families_hit.add(familyScreen)`
- Mark signature if home family: `face_ledger[face].signature_qids.add(qid)`
- Increment context counts:
  - `Clean` if `lineCOF === "C"`
  - `Bent` if `lineCOF === "O"`
  - `Broken` if `lineCOF === "F"`

### **Finalization (After 18 Answers)**

#### **a) Line Verdict Computation**
For each family:
- If `F_seen === true` → line verdict = **F**
- Else if `O_seen === true` → line verdict = **O**
- Else if `C > 0` → line verdict = **C**
- Else → **C** by default

#### **b) Face State Computation**
For each face, compute state using thresholds:

**LIT (stable presence)** if **all**:
- `Q ≥ 6` (questions hit)
- `FAM ≥ 4` (families hit)
- `SIG ≥ 2` (signature hits)
- `CLEAN ≥ 4` (clean context)
- `BROKEN ≤ 1` and `BROKEN < CLEAN`
- `MAX_FAM_SHARE ≤ 0.40` (per-screen concentration cap)
- `contrast_seen = true`

**LEAN (present, less stable)** if **all**:
- `Q ≥ 4`
- `FAM ≥ 3`
- `SIG ≥ 1`
- `CLEAN ≥ 2`
- `BROKEN < CLEAN`

**GHOST (volume without reliability)** if **any**:
- `Q ≥ 6` and `FAM ≤ 2`, or
- `BROKEN ≥ CLEAN`, or
- `MAX_FAM_SHARE > 0.40`

**COLD** if:
- `2 ≤ Q ≤ 3` and `FAM ≥ 2` and not GHOST

**ABSENT** if:
- `Q ≤ 1`

#### **c) Family Representative Resolution**
For each family's two faces:
1. If one is **LIT** and the other is not → representative = LIT
2. If both **LIT** → prefer higher `FAM`; then higher `SIG`; then higher `CLEAN`
3. If neither **LIT** → if one **LEAN** and other **COLD/ABSENT/GHOST** → representative = LEAN
4. If both **LEAN** → same tiebreaker chain (`FAM` → `SIG` → `CLEAN`)
5. If one is **GHOST** and other **LEAN/COLD** → prefer the non-GHOST

#### **d) Anchor Family Selection**
From non-picked families only:
1. Prefer verdict = C over O over F
2. Higher `C` count
3. Absence of `O_seen` then `F_seen`
4. Deterministic tiebreaker: earlier family in canonical order

### **Output Format**

**Exact JSON structure:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "line_verdicts": {
    "Control": "C|O|F",
    "Pace": "C|O|F",
    "Boundary": "C|O|F",

    { "family": "Control", "rep": "FACE/Control/Sovereign", "rep_state": "LIT", "co_present": false }
  ],
  "anchor_family": "Boundary"
}
```

- **No prose, no scores, no hidden weights**
- **Only machine-readable JSON output**
- **Everything else is optional QA**

## 🗓️ **Family Screen Scheduling (Deterministic per Session)**

### **Scheduling Rules**
- Exactly **7 family screens** are served: one per family
- For each **picked** family: serve **2 questions**
- For each **not-picked** family: serve **3** questions in **C → O → F** order
- **Question order inside family**:
  - Picked family: serve authored Q1 then Q2 (ignore Q3)
  - Not-picked: serve authored Q1 (C), Q2 (O), Q3 (F) in that exact sequence
- **Family order across the 7 screens**: Deterministically shuffle with `session_seed`
- **No mid-run reseeding** - session retains family order for full run

### **Runtime Schedule Data Structure**
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "family_order": ["Pace","Control","Truth","Boundary","Recognition","Bonding","Stress"],
    "per_family": {
      "Control": { "count": 2, "qids": ["CTRL_Q1","CTRL_Q2"] },
      "Pace":    { "count": 3, "qids": ["PACE_Q1","PACE_Q2","PACE_Q3"] },
      "Bonding": { "count": 2, "qids": ["BOND_Q1","BOND_Q2"] },
      "Stress":  { "count": 3, "qids": ["STR_Q1","STR_Q2","STR_Q3"] }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 **Session Lifecycle & State Machine**

### **States**
- `INIT` → created, families unpicked
- `PICKED` → families chosen, seeds applied
- `IN_PROGRESS` → answering questions (cursor at n of 18)
- `PAUSED` → temporarily halted; can resume
- `FINALIZING` → computing outputs
- `FINALIZED` → outputs ready and frozen
- `ABORTED` → terminated (timeout or user exit)

### **Transitions**
- `INIT` → `PICKED` on `set_picks`
- `PICKED` → `IN_PROGRESS` on `start_quiz`
- `IN_PROGRESS` → `PAUSED` on `pause`
- `PAUSED` → `IN_PROGRESS` on `resume`
- `IN_PROGRESS` → `FINALIZING` when `answers.length === 18`
- `FINALIZING` → `FINALIZED` after compute passes complete
- Any state → `ABORTED` on explicit abort or hard error

### **Invariants**
- Exactly **18** answers required to finalize (2×picked + 3×not-picked = 18)
- Each `qid` appears at most once in `answers`
- If back-navigation is allowed, the **last pick for a qid wins** (replace event, not append)

## 🔍 **Bank Validation Pipeline (Offline Linter)**

### **Validation Checks**
- All 7 families present with ≥3 authored questions each, flagged as C/O/F in order
- Each option has `lineCOF ∈ {C,O,F}`
- Each option has 0..3 tells; **≤1 tell per face per option**
- Every tell's `face_id` exists in Face Registry
- Every tell ID exists in Tell Registry
- For each face: Opportunities ≥ 6 across bank, Signature opportunities ≥ 2
- At least one **contrast** tell is authored somewhere
- No two questions share the same `qid`
- Optional: per-face opportunity spread across ≥4 families

### **Linter Output**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "summary": {
    "families": 7,
    "questions": 21,
    "options": 42,
    "tells": 78
  },
  "warnings": [
    { "code": "W_LOW_ADJACENT", "face": "FACE/Bonding/Provider", "detail": "Only 2 adjacent opportunities" }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

---

## 🔄 **Versioning & Determinism**

### **Bank Version Object**
```json
{
  "bank_id": "pff.vX.Y",
  "created_at": "ISO-8601",
  "family_registry_version": "family_registry.v1",
  "face_registry_version": "face_registry.v1",
  "tell_registry_version": "tell_registry.v1",
  "contrast_matrix_version": "contrast_matrix.v1",
  "constants_version": "constants.v1"
}
```

### **Session Binding**
- `session.bank_id` must be stored at `init_session` time
- All subsequent calls validate `bank_id` equality. Mismatch throws `E_VERSION_MISMATCH`

### **Deterministic Shuffles**
- Use `session_seed` to shuffle `family_order` and break ties in family rep resolution
- Store seed in session for reproducibility

---

## 🔒 **Privacy & Minimal Data Retention**

### **Required for Computation**
- `answers[]` with `qid`, `familyScreen`, `lineCOF`, `tells[].face_id`

### **Optional (Can be Dropped)**
- Timestamps, latency, tell_id (kept only if you want later copy like "proof tells")

### **Retention Policy**
- Keep `line_verdicts`, `face_states`, `family_reps`, `anchor_family`, and `session_id`
- Drop raw `answers[]` after derive, if you don't need audit trails

---

## ⚡ **Performance & Limits**

### **Limits**
- Max tells per option: 3
- Max families: 7 fixed
- Max faces: 14 fixed
- Memory footprint per session: O(answers + faces)

### **Latency Targets**
- `getNextQuestion`: p95 < 10ms
- `submitAnswer`: p95 < 15ms  
- `finalizeSession`: p95 < 20ms
- Max QPS: 10k+ for all operations

---

## 🧪 **Test Vectors (Minimal, Synthetic)**

### **Vector A — Clean Navigator & Spotlight; Bonding drift**
- Picks: Control, Bonding, Truth
- Not-picked: Pace, Boundary, Recognition, Stress
- Expected: Navigator LIT, Spotlight LIT, Sovereign/Seeker LEAN, Partner/Diplomat LEAN

### **Vector B — Single-family saturation (GHOST trigger)**
- All tells for Visionary authored only on Pace screens; user hits them
- Expected: Visionary GHOST (MAX_FAM_SHARE > 0.40 or FAM ≤ 2), not LIT

### **Vector C — Broken-dominant mirage**
- User repeatedly chooses options with lineCOF = F when triggering a face's tells
- Expected: `BROKEN ≥ CLEAN` → face state capped at GHOST

### **Vector D — Wide, clean coverage (true LIT)**
- One face accumulates: Q=7, FAM=5, SIG=2, CLEAN=6, BROKEN=0, contrast_seen=true
- Expected: LIT

---

## 📊 **Bank Authoring Targets (Quantitative)**

For each face across the 18-question path:
- **Opportunities:** aim 8–10 total potential appearances in full authored bank
- **Signature slots:** at least 2 on its home family
- **Adjacent spread:** ensure they appear in at least 4 other families
- **Contrast:** at least 1 high-salience contrast tell per face

---

## 🎯 **Context Mapping Clarification**

Context is derived **per answer option** from its `lineCOF` relative to the **current family screen**:
- If the option's `lineCOF = C` → **Clean** context
- If `O` → **Bent** context  
- If `F` → **Broken** context

This is independent of the user's overall verdict on that family at the end.

---

## 📏 **Caps & Normalizers (Precise Definitions)**

### **Per-screen cap `MAX_FAM_SHARE` calculation:**
- Numerator: max over families of `per_family_counts[family]`
- Denominator: `CLEAN + BENT + BROKEN` for that face
- If denominator = 0, face is ABSENT. Otherwise compare ratio to threshold (default 0.40)

### **Burst guard (coverage neutrality):**
- If the same face fires the **same tell_id** on consecutive questions within the **same family**, counts remain in context totals, but **do not** increase `families_hit`

---

## 🌐 **Minimal i18n Contract (if you localize later)**

Keep text out of the engine; reference keys only:
- `question.key`: e.g., `CTRL_Q1_STEM`
- `option.key`: e.g., `CTRL_Q1_A_TEXT`
- The engine carries `qid` and option `key` but does not store human strings

---

## 📤 **Data Export (for downstream systems)**

### **Per-face normalized record:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "face_id": "FACE/Truth/Seeker",
  "state": "LEAN",
  "familiesHit": 4,
  "signatureHits": 1,
  "clean": 3,
  "bent": 1,
  "broken": 0,
  "contrastSeen": true,
  "topProofTells": ["TELL/Truth/Seeker/check-source","TELL/Truth/Seeker/clarity-before-speak"]
}
```

### **Per-family verdict export:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "family": "Boundary",
  "verdict": "C",
  "C": 3, "O_seen": true, "F_seen": false
}
```

---

## 🔒 **Security & Trust Boundaries**

- Treat the authored bank as **untrusted input**
- Run the linter before loading a bank into production
- Validate all incoming `submit_answer` payloads against the schedule and bank versions
- Reject unknown `qid` or mismatched `bank_id`

---

## 🔧 **Extensibility**

The model supports:
- Adding new faces or families by expanding registries and authored bank
- Adding a new state (e.g., **STRONG_LIT**) by defining a stricter gate without altering existing states
- Thresholds are configurable, not hard-coded to 14 or 7

---

## 📝 **Minimal Logging (Engine Diagnostics; Optional)**

### **Event log entries:**
```json
{
  "ts": "ISO-8601",
  "type": "ANSWER_RECORDED",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "qid": "string",
  "familyScreen": "string",
  "lineCOF": "C|O|F",
  "faces": ["FACE/...","FACE/..."]
}
```

### **FINALIZED summary event:**
```json
{ "ts": "ISO-8601", "type": "FINALIZED", "session_id": "uuid", "bank_id": "pff.vX.Y" }
```

---

## 🎯 **Batch 2 Hand-off Prompt (Authoritative Summary)**

> **SYSTEM BEHAVIOR — Batch 2 Additions (authoritative):**
> 
> **A)** Maintain immutable registries for families, faces, tells, and sibling contrast tells. Each tell maps to exactly one face; some tells are flagged `contrast=true`.
> 
> **B)** On `set_picks`, create a deterministic 7-family schedule using `session_seed`. Picked families serve 2 questions (Q1..Q2). Not-picked serve 3 questions in strict C→O→F.
> 
> **C)** Provide engine APIs: `init_session`, `set_picks`, `get_next_question`, `submit_answer`, `finalize_session`, `resume_session`, `abort_session`. Each call carries `session_id` and validates `bank_id`.
> 
> **D)** On `submit_answer`, replace prior answers for the same `qid` (last pick wins); update `line_state` and `face_ledger`.
> 
> **E)** Face ledger context is derived from the option's `lineCOF`: C=Clean, O=Bent, F=Broken. Caps: ≤1 tell per face per option; ≤3 tells total per option; per-screen share ≤40% for LIT eligibility.
> 
> **F)** Finalization computes line verdicts (F beats O beats C), face states (LIT/LEAN/GHOST/COLD/ABSENT) using thresholds and contrast requirement, resolves family representatives with tie rules, and optionally selects an anchor from non-picked families.
> 
> **G)** Enforce error codes for invalid picks, qids, state misuse, and bank defects. Support version binding via `bank_id`.
> 
> **H)** Provide linter checks offline before shipping a bank (C/O/F presence, tell counts, signature/adjacent spread, contrast availability, unique qids).
> 
> **I)** Persist only the minimal necessary objects: `line_verdicts`, `face_states`, `family_reps`, `anchor_family`, and `session_id`. Optionally drop raw answers after finalization if audit is not required.

## 🎯 **Batch 3 Hand-off Prompt (Authoritative Summary)**

> **SYSTEM BEHAVIOR — Batch 3 Additions (authoritative):**
> 
> **A)** Tells are categorized as **Signature**, **Adjacent**, and optionally **Contrast**. Each option carries 0–3 tells total, max 1 tell per face per option. Avoid placing both siblings on the same option; if present, engine counts both and flags QA.
> 
> **B)** Determinism: bind sessions to `bank_id` and `bank_hash_sha256`. Family order is seeded by `session_seed ∥ bank_hash`. Events are indexed 1..18; back-edits replace the same index.
> 
> **C)** Finalization runs in fixed order: compute line verdicts from flags; compute face metrics (Q, FAM, SIG, CLEAN/BENT/BROKEN, MAX_FAM_SHARE, contrast); assign states with GHOST overrides, then LIT/LEAN gates; resolve family reps; optional anchor from non-picked.
> 
> **D)** Edge policies: picks=7 → add four deterministic O/F probes to reach 18; picks=1 → drop two probes (prefer dropping O) from not-picked to reach 18. Missing probes produce warnings, not synthetic flags.
> 
> **E)** Sanity QA flags: face LIT on broken family with majority local hits; family C with both siblings GHOST; LIT without contrast. These do not change outputs; they surface authoring issues.
> 
> **F)** Packaging: ship a signed **Bank Package** containing registries, constants, normalized bank, linter report, and SHA-256 hash. Reject mismatched packages at runtime.
> 
> **G)** Stress tests: fuzz tell floods, broken-dominant mirages, sibling ambiguity; verify caps and gates produce LIT only with wide, clean, contrast-seen evidence.
> 
> **H)** Operational knobs: constants for LIT/LEAN gates, per-screen cap, and clean override live in config; profile switches (STRICT/LENIENT) change the bank hash and require new sessions.
