## ðŸŽ¯ **SYSTEM BEHAVIOR â€” Batch 5 Additions (AUTHORITATIVE)**

### **A) Bank Builder CLI (81)**
- **Canonicalizes** bank packages from raw author files
- **Schema validates** registries and questions
- **Enforces caps** (â‰¤3 tells/option, â‰¤1 per face/option)
- **Runs linter** with comprehensive checks
- **Computes bank_hash_sha256** over canonical JSON
- **Signs with ed25519** (simulated with HMAC-SHA256)
- **Emits linter_report.json** and signature files
- **Exit codes**: 0=success, 10=schema failure, 20=linter errors, 30=signing failure

### **B) Calibration Suite (82)**
- **Threshold sweeps** without lying to yourself
- **Controlled corpora** testing with deterministic scripts
- **Guardrails**: LIT rate 5-75%, no contrast flags >15%
- **Constants profiles**: DEFAULT, STRICT, LENIENT, plus N ad-hoc variants
- **Signed calibration reports** with recommendations
- **Hard stops** for bank promotion on guardrail violations

### **C) Deterministic Replay File (83)**
- **One file replays** a session 1:1 for audits and disputes
- **Schema**: replay.v1 with session_seed, bank_id, bank_hash, answers[]
- **REPLAY_MISMATCH detection** with diff output
- **Audit store** for compliance tracking (N days retention)
- **Engine bypasses UI** and must emit exact final_snapshot

### **D) Synthetic Answer Scripts (84)**
- **Deterministic test corpora** for calibration and tests
- **Directory structure**: set_A_clean/, set_B_broken/, set_C_concentrated/
- **Script format**: picked_families + sequence of {family, qid, key}
- **Engine maps** {qid,key} to current bank deterministically
- **SCRIPT_BANK_MISMATCH** reporting for validation failures

### **E) Multi-Run Aggregation (85)**
- **Cross-session rollup** without back-propagation
- **Line consensus**: majority vote C > O > F, tie â†’ most recent
- **Face presence rollup**: track LIT/LEAN/GHOST counts across sessions
- **Stability flags**: pace_stable, bonding_offset_persistent
- **No math back-propagates** into single sessions

### **F) Compatibility Compute (86)**
- **User comparison scoring** (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
- **Line pairing**: align/tension/conflict mechanics
- **Face pairing**: same/complement/clash relations
- **Score class rules**: â‰¥5 families align + no clash = GREEN
- **Explanatory tags** for score reasoning
- **Never touches core math** - pure analysis module

### **G) Governance System (87)**
- **Roles**: Author, QA, Owner, Observer with permission matrix
- **Promotion checklist**: linter ok, calibration recommendation, QA summary
- **Approval workflows** with required QA + Owner sign-off
- **Promotion records** with audit trail and metadata hashes
- **Hard gates** prevent low-quality bank promotion

### **H) Incident Playbook (88)**
- **Triggers**: E_BANK_DEFECT_RUNTIME > 0, qa_flags rate doubles, finalize success dip
- **Data toggles**: freeze bank, rollback to previous, mark sessions invalid
- **Incident reports** with symptoms, actions, affected sessions
- **Recovery procedures** and escalation paths

### **I) SDK Stubs (89)**
- **Engine adapters** for JavaScript, Python, Java, C#
- **Error mapping** from engine errors to SDK exceptions
- **Type summaries** for language-agnostic documentation
- **Input validation** and consistent error handling
- **Language-specific stubs** with proper exception handling

### **J) Acceptance Gates (90)**
- **Auto-block deploys** on quality issues

- **Face opportunities**: <6 total or <2 signature blocks deployment
- **Bank diff risks**: R_LINE_FLOW_CHANGE without explicit override
- **Authoring QA**: families_missing_any_COF > 0 blocks deployment

### **K) Replay Audit Store (91)**
- **Compliance tracking** for N days (default 90)
- **Audit records**: replay_id, bank_id, bank_hash, result (MATCH/MISMATCH)
- **Search and filtering** by bank, result, date range
- **Cleanup procedures** for expired audits
- **Export capabilities** for compliance reporting

### **L) Multi-Env Config (92)**
- **Separate signing keys** per environment (dev/stage/prod)
- **Distinct bank registries** per environment
- **No cross-pollination** between environments
- **Environment isolation** validation

- **Hash generation** from canonical objects
- **ID extraction** and normalization utilities

### **P) Performance Envelope (96)**

- **Memory targets**: â‰¤64KB typical per session
- **Throughput targets**: 10k+ QPS
- **Performance monitoring** with real-time alerts
- **Regression detection** and recommendations

### **Q) Bank Freeze Policy (97)**
- **Single active bank** per environment for new sessions
- **â‰¤3 legacy banks** available for replay only
- **Freeze prevention** mechanisms
- **Rollback procedures** to previous banks
- **Lifecycle management** with retention policies

### **R) Deprecation & Sunset (98)**
- **Bank lifecycle**: active â†’ deprecated â†’ sunset â†’ archived
- **Sunset procedures** with notice periods
- **Compatibility mapping** for downstream consumers
- **Data retention** policies (regulatory vs operational)
- **Cleanup procedures** for expired data

### **S) Minimal CLI (99)**
- **pff pack** â†’ emits bank package (81)
- **pff run --replay** â†’ emits snapshot
- **pff calibrate** â†’ emits calibration report (82)
- **Exit codes** non-zero on mismatches or guardrail failures
- **Comprehensive help** and usage information

### **T) Batch 5 Hand-off Block (100)**
